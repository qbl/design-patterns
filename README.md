# Learning Notes on Design Patterns

## 1. Introduction

In short, a pattern is a solution to a problem in a context. Design patterns in Object Oriented scope are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.

Design patterns in object oriented are classified by two criteria: purpose and scope. A pattern can have one of the following purpose:
1. Creational Purpose
    Creational patterns concern the process of object creation.
2. Structural Purpose
    Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects.
3. Behavioral Purpose
    Behavioral patterns characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility.
